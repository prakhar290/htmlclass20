<body>
<p>boolean javascript gives the output only in the form of true or false as shown below:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
var x=5;
var y=5;
var z=6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML= (x==y)+ "<br>" + (y==z);
</script>
<p>here the true value comes first because we have checked the equality of x and y as both of them have value 5 so the ans is true<br>
in the next line we comapred x and z but the ans came to be false because x has value 5 and z has value 6.</p>
